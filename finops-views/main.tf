# ==============================================================================
# MODULE: finops-views – FinOps Reporting SQL Views Factory
# ==============================================================================
# Creates 6 BigQuery views that transform raw GCP billing export data into
# KPI-ready tables. Each view is a google_bigquery_table with a SELECT query
# against the auto-created gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX table.
#
# Views created:
#   1. daily_cost               – Day-grain net cost per project/service
#   2. monthly_cost_trend       – Monthly rollup by project/service
#   3. cost_by_project          – Monthly net cost + % of total per project
#   4. top_skus                 – Monthly cost ranked by service/SKU
#   5. discounts_and_commitments – Credits by type (CUD/SUD/free tier/promos)
#   6. cost_anomalies           – Daily z-score spike detection
#
# CRITICAL: Credits are already negative in Billing Export – ALWAYS
#   net = cost + SUM(credits.amount), NEVER cost - credits.
#
# Views created:
#
# Usage example:
#   module "finops_views" {
#     source = "../modules/finops-views"
#     project_id              = module.finops_dataset.project_id
#     dataset_id              = module.finops_dataset.dataset_id
#     billing_export_table_id = "myco-finops.billing_export.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX"
#   }
